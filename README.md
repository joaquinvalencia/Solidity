## Why We Chose Solidity

Our group chose to present on the programming language Solidity. Solidity is an object-oriented language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that exist within blockchains and in this case the Ethereum blockchain. The language is compiled to bytecode and is executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). We chose to present on this programming language simply because some members in our group have interest or experience with cryptocurrency and blockchains.
